# CE Style Guides

Here we have all the CORE, COMPONENTS, COMPOUND, SECTIONS and TEMPLATE scss-code organized in the same as is done on the Shopify repo.
In addition to the SCSS we also save the html for each of them.

Development of a new CORE, COMPONENTS, COMPOUND, SECTIONS and TEMPLATE must always start from here. 
Once the HTML and SCSS is fine a works well, code is integrate in Shopify repo with liquid.
